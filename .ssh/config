# Added by OrbStack: 'orb' SSH host for Linux machines
# This only works if it's at the top of ssh_config (before any Host blocks).
# This won't be added again if you remove it.

# zmx — persistent sessions on remote hosts
# Customize: change `zm.*` to your host pattern, set HostName to your server IP
# Usage: ssh zm.shell, ssh zm.nvim, etc. — each gets its own zmx session via %k
# Requires zmx installed on the remote
#Host = zm.*
#	HostName 192.168.1.xxx
#	RemoteCommand zmx attach %k
#	RequestTTY yes
#	ControlMaster auto
